# There are a few principal functions reading data into R.
# • read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
# • readLines, for reading lines of a text file
# • source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
# • dget, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
# • load, for reading in saved workspaces
# • unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form
# There are of course, many R packages that have been developed to read in all kinds of other datasets,
# and you may need to resort to one of these packages if you are working in a specific area.
# There are analogous functions for writing data to files
# • write.table, for writing tabular data to text files (i.e. CSV) or connections
# • writeLines, for writing character data line-by-line to a file or connection
# • dump, for dumping a textual representation of multiple R objects
# • dput, for outputting a textual representation of an R object
# • save, for saving an arbitrary number of R objects in binary format (possibly compressed) to
# a file.
# • serialize, for converting an R object into a binary format for outputting to a connection
